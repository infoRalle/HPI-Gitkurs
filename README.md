# HPI-Gitkurs

As a part of the HPI-GitCourse I created this repo to start playing with Git.
Throughout the course I was able to create a local repo and push them to gitHub.
I am more then happy to made this course. Its free and it was in german. 
Very refreshing to get tought again in german after such a long time.
